# ### Exercises: Level 2

# 1. Write a pattern which identifies if a string is a valid python variable
regex_python_var = '^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*'

def is_valid_variable(word):
    if re.search(regex_python_var,word):

    else:
        return False

print(is_valid_variable('first_name')) # True
print(is_valid_variable('first-name')) # False
print(is_valid_variable('1first_name')) # False
print(is_valid_variable('firstname')) # True


# ### Exercises: Level 3

# 1. Clean the following text. After cleaning, count three most frequent words in the string.

#     ```py

#     print(clean_text(sentence));
#     I am a teacher and I love teaching There is nothing as more rewarding as educating and empowering people I found teaching more interesting than any other jobs Does this motivate you to be a teacher
#     print(most_frequent_words(cleaned_text)) # [(3, 'I'), (2, 'teaching'), (2, 'teacher')]
