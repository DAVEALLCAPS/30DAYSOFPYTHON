# ## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 10

# ### Exercises: Level 1

# 1. Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
for number in range(11):
    print(number,end=" ")

i = 0
print()

while i < 11:
    print(i,end=" ")
    i += 1

# 2. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
print()
for number in range(10,-1,-1):
    print(number,end=" ")

i = 10
print()
while i > -1:
    print(i,end=" ")
    i -= 1
# 3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

print()
symb = '#'
i = 1
while i < 8:
    print(symb * i)
    i += 1

# 4. Use nested loops to create the following:

print()
for x in range(8):
    for y in range(8):
        print(symb, end=" ")
    print()

#    ```sh
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    # # # # # # # #
#    ```

# 5. Print the following pattern:

print()
for number in range(11):
    print("{} x {} = ".format(number, number), number * number)
#    ```sh
#    0 x 0 = 0
#    1 x 1 = 1
#    2 x 2 = 4
#    3 x 3 = 9
#    4 x 4 = 16
#    5 x 5 = 25
#    6 x 6 = 36
#    7 x 7 = 49
#    8 x 8 = 64
#    9 x 9 = 81
#    10 x 10 = 100
#    ```

# 6. Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using 
# a for loop and print out the items.
my_list = ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask']
for number in my_list:
    print(number)
# 7. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
for number in range(101):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
# 8. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers
for number in range(101):
    if number % 2 != 0:
        print(number)
# ### Exercises: Level 2
    
# 1.  Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.

#    ```sh
#    The sum of all numbers is 5050.
#    ```

# 1. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

#     ```sh
#     The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
#     ```

# ### Exercises: Level 3

# 1. Go to the data folder and use the [countries.py](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries.py) file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word _land_.
# 1. This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
# 2. Go to the data folder and use the [countries_data.py](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries-data.py) file. 
#    1. What are the total number of languages in the data
#    2. Find the ten most spoken languages from the data
#    3. Find the 10 most populated countries in the world
