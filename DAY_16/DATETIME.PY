# 1. Get the current day, month, year, hour, minute and timestamp from datetime module
now = datetime.now()

# 4. Calculate the time difference between now and new year.
today = date(year=2022, month=9, day=7)
new_year = date(year=2023, month=1, day=1)
til_new_year = new_year - today
print(til_new_year)
# 5. Calculate the time difference between 1 January 1970 and now.
jan_1_1970 = date(year=1970, month=1, day=1)
since_jan_1970 = today - jan_1_1970
print(since_jan_1970)
# 6. Think, what can you use the datetime module for? Examples:
